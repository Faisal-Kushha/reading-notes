## Understanding Scope

In programming, the scope of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you’ll distinguish two general scopes:

1. Global scope: The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.

2. Local scope: The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.

Scope came about because early programming languages (like BASIC) only had global names. With this kind of name, any part of the program could modify any variable at any time, so maintaining and debugging large programs could become a real nightmare. To work with global names, you’d need to keep all the code in mind at the same time to know what the value of a given name is at any time. This was an important side-effect of not having scopes.

Some languages like Python use scope to avoid this kind of problem. When you use a language that implements scope, there’s no way for you to access all the variables in a program at all locations in that program. In this case, your ability to access a given name will depend on where you’ve defined that name.

The names in your programs will have the scope of the block of code in which you define them. When you can access the value of a given name from someplace in your code, you’ll say that the name is in scope. If you can’t access the name, then you’ll say that the name is out of scope.

## Names and Scopes in Python

Since Python is a dynamically-typed language, variables in Python come into existence when you first assign them a value. On the other hand, functions and classes are available after you define them using def or class, respectively. Finally, modules exist after you import them.

Python uses the location of the name assignment or definition to associate it with a particular scope. In other words, where you assign or define a name in your code determines the scope or visibility of that name.

For example, if you assign a value to a name inside a function, then that name will have a local Python scope. In contrast, if you assign a value to a name outside of all functions—say, at the top level of a module—then that name will have a global Python scope.

# Python Scope vs Namespace

In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the namespace. As you’ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as dictionaries that map names to objects. These dictionaries are commonly called namespaces. These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They’re stored in a special attribute called .** dict **.

Names at the top level of a module are stored in the module’s namespace. In other words, they’re stored in the module’s .** dict ** attribute. Take a look at the following code:

```
>>> import sys
>>> sys.__dict__.keys()
dict_keys(['__name__', '__doc__', '__package__',..., 'argv', 'ps1', 'ps2'])
```

After you import sys, you can use .keys() to inspect the keys of sys.** dict **. This returns a list with all the names defined at the top level of the module. In this case, you can say that . ** dict ** holds the namespace of sys and is a concrete representation of the module scope.

As a further example, suppose that you need to use the name ps1, which is defined in sys. If you know how .** dict ** and namespaces work in Python, then you can reference ps1 in at least two different ways:

1. Using the dot notation on the module’s name in the form module.name
2. Using a subscription operation on .**dict** in the form module.**dict**['name']

Take a look at the following code:

```
>>> sys.ps1
'>>> '
>>> sys.__dict__['ps1']
'>>> '
```

Once you’ve imported sys you can access ps1 using the dot notation on sys. You can also access ps1 using a dictionary key lookup with the key 'ps1'. Both actions return the same result, '>>> '.

Whenever you use a name, such as a variable or a function name, Python searches through different scope levels (or namespaces) to determine whether the name exists or not. If the name exists, then you’ll always get the first occurrence of it. Otherwise, you’ll get an error. You’ll cover this search mechanism in the next section.

### Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope

Python resolves names using the so-called LEGB rule, which is named after the Python scope for names. The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. Here’s a quick overview of what these terms mean:

- Local (or function) scope is the code block or body of any Python function or lambda expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It’s created at function call, not at function definition, so you’ll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.

- Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an inner or nested function, then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.

- Global (or module) scope is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.

- Built-in scope is a special Python scope that’s created or loaded whenever you run a script or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions, exceptions, and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It’s automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script.

The LEGB rule is a kind of name lookup procedure, which determines the order in which Python looks up names. For example, if you reference a given name, then Python will look that name up sequentially in the local, enclosing, global, and built-in scope. If the name exists, then you’ll get the first occurrence of it. Otherwise, you’ll get an error.

In summary, when you use nested functions, names are resolved by first checking the local scope or the innermost function’s local scope. Then, Python looks at all enclosing scopes of outer functions from the innermost scope to the outermost scope. If no match is found, then Python looks at the global and built-in scopes. If it can’t find the name, then you’ll get an error.

At any given time during execution, you’ll have at most four active Python scopes—local, enclosing, global, and built-in—depending on where you are in the code. On the other hand, you’ll always have at least two active scopes, which are the global and built-in scopes. These two scopes will always be available for you.

## Functions: The Local Scope

The local scope or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you’re also creating a new local scope. On the other hand, you can think of each def statement and lambda expression as a blueprint for new local scopes. These local scopes will come into existence whenever you call the function at hand.

By default, parameters and names that you assign inside a function exist only within the function or local scope associated with the function call. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed and the names are forgotten. Here’s how this works:

```
>>> def square(base):
...     result = base ** 2
...     print(f'The square of {base} is: {result}')
...
>>> square(10)
The square of 10 is: 100
>>> result  # Isn't accessible from outside square()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    result
NameError: name 'result' is not defined
>>> base  # Isn't accessible from outside square()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    base
NameError: name 'base' is not defined
>>> square(20)
The square of 20 is: 400
```

square() is a function that computes the square of a given number, base. When you call the function, Python creates a local scope containing the names base (an argument) and result (a local variable). After the first call to square(), base holds a value of 10 and result holds a value of 100. The second time, the local names will not remember the values that were stored in them the first time the function was called. Notice that base now holds the value 20 and result holds 400.

Since you can’t access local names from statements that are outside the function, different functions can define objects with the same name. Check out this example:

```
>>> def cube(base):
...     result = base ** 3
...     print(f'The cube of {base} is: {result}')
...
>>> cube(30)
The cube of 30 is: 27000
```

Notice that you define cube() using the same variable and parameter that you used in square(). However, since cube() can’t see the names inside the local scope of square() and vice versa, both functions work as expected without any name collision.

You can avoid name collisions in your programs by properly using the local Python scope. This also makes functions more self-contained and creates maintainable program units. Additionally, since you can’t change local names from remote places in your code, your programs will be easier to debug, read, and modify.

You can inspect the names and parameters of a function using .** code **, which is an attribute that holds information on the function’s internal code. Take a look at the code below:

```
>>> square.__code__.co_varnames
('base', 'result')
>>> square.__code__.co_argcount
1
>>> square.__code__.co_consts
(None, 2, 'The square of ', ' is: ')
>>> square.__code__.co_name
'square'
```

In this code example, you inspect .** code ** on square(). This is a special attribute that holds information about the code of a Python function. In this case, you see that .co_varnames holds a tuple containing the names that you define inside square().

## Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope

Enclosing or nonlocal scope is observed when you nest functions inside other functions. The enclosing scope was added in Python 2.2. It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing function’s local scopes. Names that you define in the enclosing Python scope are commonly known as nonlocal names. Consider the following code:

```
>>> def outer_func():
...     # This block is the Local scope of outer_func()
...     var = 100  # A nonlocal var
...     # It's also the enclosing scope of inner_func()
...     def inner_func():
...         # This block is the Local scope of inner_func()
...         print(f"Printing var from inner_func(): {var}")
...
...     inner_func()
...     print(f"Printing var from outer_func(): {var}")
...
>>> outer_func()
Printing var from inner_func(): 100
Printing var from outer_func(): 100
>>> inner_func()
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'inner_func' is not defined
```

When you call outer_func(), you’re also creating a local scope. The local scope of outer_func() is, at the same time, the enclosing scope of inner_func(). From inside inner_func(), this scope is neither the global scope nor the local scope. It’s a special scope that lies in between those two scopes and is known as the enclosing scope.

All the names that you create in the enclosing scope are visible from inside inner_func(), except for those created after you call inner_func(). Here’s a new version of outer_fun() that shows this point:

```
>>> def outer_func():
...     var = 100
...     def inner_func():
...         print(f"Printing var from inner_func(): {var}")
...         print(f"Printing another_var from inner_func(): {another_var}")
...
...     inner_func()
...     another_var = 200  # This is defined after calling inner_func()
...     print(f"Printing var from outer_func(): {var}")
...
>>> outer_func()
Printing var from inner_func(): 100
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    outer_func()
  File "<stdin>", line 7, in outer_func
    inner_func()
  File "<stdin>", line 5, in inner_func
    print(f"Printing another_var from inner_func(): {another_var}")
NameError: free variable 'another_var' referenced before assignment in enclosing
 scope
```

When you call outer_func() the code runs down to the point in which you call inner_func(). The last statement of inner_func() tries to access another_var. At this point, another_var isn’t defined yet, so Python raises a NameError because it can’t find the name that you’re trying to use.

Last but not least, you can’t modify names in the enclosing scope from inside a nested function unless you declare them as nonlocal in the nested function. You’ll cover how to use nonlocal later in this tutorial.
