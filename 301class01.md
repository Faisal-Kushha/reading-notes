## Props
“Props” is a special keyword in React, which stands for `Properties` and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

### Using Props in React

In order to use the props in react we have first to  define an attribute and its value(data), then pass it to child component(s) by using Props, and to get the final result we have to render the Props Data.

The flow of props go down from one component into its children. And it flows down one way through a react app.

## JSX
[JSK](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) is a syntax extension to JavaScript. Which is recommended to use with React to describe what the User Interface should look like. React doesn’t require using JSX, but it is helpful to use it as a visual aid when working with User Interface inside the JavaScript code.

#### React has the ability to manage its own state by pass it down into its children and this is how to convert a React element to a DOM element. To [render](https://reactjs.org/docs/rendering-elements.html) a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render().
