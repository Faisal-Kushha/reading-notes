## The Best Whiteboard Interview Advice I Ever Received

Whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview. This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apart.

Here are the best advice for going through a whiteboard interview:

The best advice ever is to `Communicate`: The best piece of technical interview advice is to communicate! You should take some very important steps before moving forward:

- Restate the Question: Restate the question for the interviewer and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you don’t fully understand what they’re asking for — perhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

- Ask About Edge Cases: It’s still not time to dive right into coding the solution. Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them. In many cases, the interviewer hasn’t even thought about edge cases and will make something up. That’s great — it shows you’re analytical and will work hard to try to prevent bugs (which often crop up due to edge cases).

- Ask About Test Cases: This is free and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But it’s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think “ah, this candidate knows about testing!”

- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense: you should not actually start writing code in an actual language. You’ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know you’re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later. (Coincidentally, this is a reasonable way to write actual code as well). You can ask if your pseudocode makes sense to the interviewer. It’s possible they will be the type that doesn’t want to “give you hints,” but it’s also possible they’ll be more interested in how you think and want to discuss your pseudocode with you. When I interview candidates, I’m more interested in the latter — rarely do we ever actually develop software in a vacuum.

- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good:
  You should convert your pseudocode into actual code. You don’t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. If they give you trouble, just say you’ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

- Stuck? Ask for Help!: If you’re having trouble along the way, it’s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.

## 7 tips to ace a programming interview

1. Take a few minutes: You should not waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head. Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Then take a few minutes and think through the basics of the problem, and decide on an approach. Then re-engage the interviewer, and let him know what you’ve concluded. Don’t forget to provide your reasoning!

2. Write down the steps of the solution: Even after you have an idea of how to solve the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.

3. Write pseudocode first: You should start writing some pseudocode first. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.

4. Don’t sweat the small stuff: Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.

5. Sit down. Be humble: A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess like :

- Are you able to express your ideas and solutions clearly and effectively?
- Do you treat the interviewer with respect?
- How do you accept criticism (technical, constructive or otherwise)?
- Are you able to collaborate with others to come up with solutions?
- Do you communicate in a way that demonstrates empathy?
- Are you honest (especially about yourself)?

6. Come prepared: When it comes to programming interviews, there is no substitute for HOBIS (which stands for Hours of Butt-In-Seat). If you want to be ready, you have to put in the time. It’s important in order to maximize your chances of acing the interview, but it’s also important for your peace of mind during the interview and afterwards. In the interview, knowing that you’ve done all you can to prepare helps you stay calm and cool, and increases your chances of success. And afterwards, regardless of the outcome, knowing that you could not have reasonably done more to prepare helps you feel proud of your work and start moving towards your next goal.

7. Review your work: You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution. If this happens, it’s tempting to say “Well, I’m done!”. Interviews are stressful and we want them to be over as fast as possible. Instead, if you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted. In particular, focus on these two areas, as they receive heavy scrutiny in interviews:

- Algorithmic efficiency.
- Correctness.
