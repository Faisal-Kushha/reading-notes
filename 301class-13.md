# Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry

**What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?**

The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.

**Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?**

It was a big deal when they got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home. And they were way ahead of their colleagues who did not.

**What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?**

1. Data launching date(year).
2. Gender classification percentage.
3. Ethnicity classification percentage.

**When are diversity efforts most successful?**

Diversity efforts are most successful when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters.

**Why do diverse companies perform better?**

Because diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes.

**Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.**

Because when the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups.
