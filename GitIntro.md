### In order to understand Git we have to know what Version Control is.

## Version Control: is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

### Version Control types:
* **Local Version Control**: A Local VCS entails one database on your hard disk that stores changes to files.

* **Centralized Version Control**: This system entails a single server storing all changes and file versions, which can be accessed by various clients.

* **Distributed Version Control**: In this system clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history.

### Git: 
It is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems).

### History of Git:
Git traces its roots to the open source software project Linux kernel. Developers of this project began using a DVCS called BitKeeper in 2002. In 2005, many of these developers stopped using this DVCS due to tension between the Linux kernel community and the company behind BitKeeper’s and the eventual revocation of the DVCS’ gratis status. Subsequently, Linus Torvalds, the chief architect of the Linux kernel, began creating Git. With the intention of creating a DVCS with a workflow design similar to that of BitKeeper, which was also fast, Git allowed for non-linear development via multiple branches, could support large projects, possessed strong mechanisms preventing corruption, and had a simple design. Since its inception in 2005, Git has become one of the most utilized Version Control Systems in the world.[History of Git](https://blog.udemy.com/git-tutorial-a-comprehensive-guide/#5)
