# Mindset

## Mindset definition based to Merriam-Webster dictionary is: 
> A mental attitude or inclination

### There are two type of mindset:
 1. **Growth Mindset** : *we could define it as the abilities that can be developed through hard working and the continuous learning process.*
 2. **Fixed Mindset** : *which is the opposite of Growth Mindset, it consider the same abilities as a fixed traits in human being and its hard to change it.*

 ### The way Growth Mindset Works Based on a studies published on [www.psychologytoday.com](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/growth-mindset)
In studies that examine mindset, participants are given statements such as: “You have a certain amount of intelligence, and you really can’t do much to change it.” Participants who disagree with such statements are considered to have more of a growth mindset. However, agreeing with such a statement would mean that the participant has more of a fixed mindset.

 
 
 
 #### I'm trying to follow the Growth Mindset approach by:
 * Get inspired from others success stories.
 * Accept the criticism and learn from my mistakes.
 * Make an effort by working as hard as I can.
