## Pain and Suffering

Pain is what happens during your journey. Suffering is the story that we layer on top of what happens. In other words Suffering is the shell that cover the pain.

**Whatâ€™s your perspective?**

Everything in this life had a price; and the price for success is PAIN, the harder you work the more you will get `No Pain No Gain`. However, you need to have the right motivation that will push you forward everyday to keep going on and handle the pain.

**Why are you doing this?**

I started this journey because I'm seeking a better life. I have the strength and determination to become a software engineer, no matter what hurdles I have to overcome.

**Do you want what comes at the end of this journey?**

My goal is to attain a solid career in technology field. And I committed myself to effectively take the advantage of this opportunity.

**Are you doing this for you?**

## Beginners Guide to Big O

Big O specifically describes the worst-case scenario, and can be used to describe the execution time required or the space used (e.g. in memory or on disk) by an algorithm.

`O(1)` describes an algorithm that will always execute in the same time (or space) regardless of the size of the input data set.

`O(N)` describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set.

`O(N2)` represents an algorithm whose performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data set.

This is common with algorithms that involve nested iterations over the data set. Deeper nested iterations will result in O(N3), O(N4) etc.

`O(2N)` denotes an algorithm whose growth doubles with each additon to the input data set.

The growth curve of an O(2N) function is exponential - starting off very shallow, then rising meteorically.

Binary search is a technique used to search sorted data sets. It works by selecting the middle element of the data set, essentially the median, and compares it against a target value.

## Names and Values in Python

In Python, we say that Names refer to Values:

`x = 3`

The name `x` refers to the value `3`. So once use the name x, we will get the value `3`:

`print(x+2)` = `5`

There ain't a rule that say a value can only have one name. An assignment statement can make a second name refer to the same value.

` x = 3`

`y = x `

Now x and y both refer to the same value

Neither x or y is the actual name. They both have an equal result, each one of them refers to same Values.
