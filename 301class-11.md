# Mongo and Mongoose

**Five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:**

| SQL                                                                  | NoSQL                                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Relational Databases (RDBMS)                                         | Non-relational or distributed database                                                                             |
| Table based databases                                                | Document based                                                                                                     |
| Have predefined schema for unstructured data                         | Have dynamic schema for unstructured data                                                                          |
| Vertically scalable                                                  | Horizontally scalable                                                                                              |
| Use structured query language for defining and manipulating the data | Queries are focused on collection of documents. Sometimes it is also called as UnQL (Unstructured Query Language). |
| Examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL                 | Examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb                                   |

**What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
Give a real world example.**

SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.

**What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
Give a real world example.**

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose.

**Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**

NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage

**Which type of database is best for scalability?**

NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic.

**What does SQL stand for?**

SQL stands for Structured Query Language which is a programming language held in relational database management system.

**What is a relational database?**

A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.

**What type of structure does a relational database work with?**

Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables. In a relational database, each row in the table is a record with a unique ID called the key.

**What is a ‘schema’?**

Schema refers to the organization of data as a blueprint of how the database is constructed (divided into database tables.

**What is a NoSQL database?**

NoSQL refers to "non- SQL " or "non-relational" database provides a mechanism for storage and retrieval of data that is modeled in means other than the tabular relations used in relational databases.

**How does it work?**

Each type of NoSQL database would be designed with a specific needed situation in mind, and there would be technical reasons for how each kind of database would be organized. The simplest type to describe is the document database.

**What is inside of a Mongo database?**

A Database contains a collection, and a collection contains documents and the documents contain data, they are related to each other.

**Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**

`MongoDB`is more flexible. SQL is more apt for smaller datasets whereas MongoDB is capable of handling large unstructured datasets. SQL is recognized for its high performance, flexibility, reliable data protection, high availability, and management ease.

**What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**

1. Immature and Less Support: NoSQL is recently introduced. NoSQL does not have as vast a community as SQL. Similarly, it lacks features needed, which are present in traditional SQL databases.

2. Lack of Analytics: NoSQL is designed to tackle large amounts of data having varying nature. However, when it comes to analytics and drawing business insights, NoSQL is not as efficient as SQL. This again revives the SQL. Today applications usually adopt both the models for varying nature of the use case.

3. Lack of Consistency: NoSQL suffers from consistency when it comes to storing large amounts of data. SQL databases provide something called ACID transactions (Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, Durability) meaning that guarantee of the reliable transactions is present. NoSQL lacks this, compelling programmers to write their custom code for this.
