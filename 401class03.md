# Readings: FileIO & Exceptions

One of the most common tasks that you can do with Python is reading and writing files. Whether it’s writing to a simple text file, reading a complicated server log, or even analyzing raw byte data, all of these situations require reading or writing a file.

**What Is a File?**

At its core, a file is a contiguous set of bytes used to store data. This data is organized in a specific format and can be anything as simple as a text file or as complicated as a program executable. In the end, these byte files are then translated into binary 1 and 0 for easier processing by the computer.

Files on most modern file systems are composed of three main parts:

1. Header: metadata about the contents of the file (file name, size, type, and so on)

2. Data: contents of the file as written by the creator or editor
3. End of file (EOF): special character that indicates the end of the file

**File Paths**

When you access a file on an operating system, a file path is required. The file path is a string that represents the location of a file. It’s broken up into three major parts:

1. Folder Path: the file folder location on the file system where subsequent folders are separated by a forward slash / (Unix) or backslash \ (Windows)
2. File Name: the actual name of the file
3. Extension: the end of the file path pre-pended with a period (.) used to indicate the file type

**Line Endings**

One problem often encountered when working with file data is the representation of a new line or line ending. The line ending has its roots from back in the Morse Code era, when a specific pro-sign was used to communicate the end of a transmission or the end of a line.

Windows uses the CR+LF characters to indicate a new line, while Unix and the newer Mac versions use just the LF character. This can cause some complications when you’re processing files on an operating system that is different than the file’s source.

**Character Encodings**

Another common problem that you may face is the encoding of the byte data. An encoding is a translation from byte data to human readable characters. This is typically done by assigning a numerical value to represent a character. The two most common encodings are the ASCII and UNICODE Formats.

ASCII is actually a subset of Unicode (UTF-8), meaning that ASCII and Unicode share the same numerical to character values. It’s important to note that parsing a file with the incorrect character encoding can lead to failures or misrepresentation of the character. For example, if a file was created using the UTF-8 encoding, and you try to parse it using the ASCII encoding, if there is a character that is outside of those 128 values, then an error will be thrown.

**Opening and Closing a File in Python**

When you want to work with a file, the first thing to do is to open it. This is done by invoking the open() built-in function. open() has a single required argument that is the path to the file.

**Python Exceptions**

A Python program terminates as soon as it encounters an error. In Python, an error can be a syntax error or an exception. In this article, you will see what an exception is and how it differs from a syntax error. After that, you will learn about raising exceptions and making assertions. Then, you’ll finish with a demonstration of the try and except block.
