### Document Object Model(DOM)

`DOM` is what the browser creates once you load your webpage, in other words it is a way that the browser read and translate the HTML file in order to let the user interact with the webpage by using JavaScript to do some changes.

`element nodes`, `attribute nodes` and `text nodes`.
