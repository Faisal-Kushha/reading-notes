## State and Props

[What are component lifecycle events?](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093)
React lets you define components as classes or functions. The methods that you are able to use on these are called lifecycle events. These methods can be called during the lifecycle of a component, and they allow you to update the UI and application states. 

In the lifecycle the `render` happened before `componentDidMount`, and the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React is `Mounting`, the order that the event happen is: 

1. `constructor`

2. `render`

3. `componentDidMount`

4. `React Updates`

5. `componentWillUnmount`

The [componentDidMount](https://medium.com/@joshuablankenshipnola/react-component-lifecycle-events-cb77e670a093) it is a method and it invoked immediately after a component is mounted. If you need to load anything using a network request or initialize the DOM, it should go here. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions.

[Handling events](https://reactjs.org/docs/handling-events.html) with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:

1. React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase.
2. In JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.
