# NODE.JS

There are a numbers of definitions to be found for Node.js:

1. Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.

2. Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google’s V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library.

**The V8 engine** is an open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers such as Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that the computer can execute.

The creator of Node (Ryan Dahl) took the V8 engine and enhanced it with various features, such as a file system API, an HTTP library, and a number of operating system–related utility methods.Which means that Node.js is a program that we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers.

**[npm](https://nodejs.org/en/knowledge/getting-started/npm/what-is-npm/)** is two things: first and foremost, it is an online repository for the publishing of open-source Node.js projects; second, it is a command-line utility for interacting with said repository that aids in package installation, version management, and dependency management.

What version of node are you running on your machine?
node-v12.21.0

What version of npm are you running on your machine?
6.14.13

What command would you type to install a library/package called ‘jshint’?

`npm install -g jshint`

`node` is used for developing applications that make heavy use of the ability to run JavaScript both on the client, as well as on server side and therefore benefit from the re-usability of code and the lack of context switching.

### Pair Programming

Six reasons for pair programming:

1. Greater efficiency
2. Engaged collaboration
3. Learning from fellow students
4. Social skills
5. Job interview readiness
6. Work environment readiness

In your experience, I found that the most beneficial reasons in pair programming are: Social skills, Work environment readiness.

Pair programming works as the follow: There are two roles: the Driver and the Navigator.

1. The `Driver` is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard Handling the “mechanics” of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and—of course writing—code.

2. The `Navigator` uses their words to guide the Driver but does not provide any direct input to the computer. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.
