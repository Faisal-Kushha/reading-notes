## JavaScript
### Events 

`Events` are the things that happen to HTML elements and it can be something the browser or a user does, such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked. JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. Binding is the process of which event is about to happen, and which element shall allow that event to happen. Once the event occurs on an element, it will force the JavaScript function to run. 

The most commonly used events are W3C DOM 
events, although there are others in the HTMLS 
specification as well as browser-specific events.
