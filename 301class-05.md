## Putting it all together

You can break a mock into a component heirarchy by drawing boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names as below:

The `single responsibility principle` is a component that has one reason to change when it implements one responsibility, applying the Single Responsibility Principle often leads to developing smaller pieces of code where each is focused on just one task. Then we can have these pieces cooperate together to perform more complex operations.

Build a `static version` of application is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. To build a static version of app that renders the data model, you have to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props.

### The [three questions](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) we can ask to determine if something is state:

1. Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.

2. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.

3. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

### In order to identify where [state needs to live](https://reactjs.org/docs/thinking-in-react.html) we have to follow these steps:

1. Identify every component that renders something based on that state.

2. Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).

3. Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.

4. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.
