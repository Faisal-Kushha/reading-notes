## FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING

**What is functional programming?**

`Functional programming` is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

**What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?**

The `pure function` should returns the same result if given the same arguments and it does not cause any observable side effects. It should not read external files and it should not relies on a random number generator.

Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result. We don’t need to think of situations when the same parameter has different results — because it will never happen.

**What are the benefits of a pure function?**

`Pure functions benefits`:

The code’s definitely easier to test. We don’t need to mock anything. So we can unit test pure functions with different contexts:

Given a parameter `A` → expect the function to return value `B`

Given a parameter `C` → expect the function to return value `D`

**What is immutability?**

Unchanging over time or unable to be changed. When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created. If you want to change an immutable object, you can’t. Instead, you create a new object with the new value.

**What is Referential transparency?**

`pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`

**What is a module?**

A module is a collection of JavaScript functions and objects that can be used by external applications. Describing a piece of code as a module refers less to what the code is and more to what it does—any Node.js file or collection of files can be considered a module if its functions and data are made usable to external programs.

**What does the word ‘require’ do?**

The basic functionality of `require` is that it reads a JavaScript file, executes the file, and then proceeds to return the exports object.

**How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?**

To do this, you’ll need to import the fs module, a standard Node.js module for working with files, and then use the module’s `readFile ()` function. Your program will read the file, store its contents in a variable, then log its contents to the console.

**What do we have to do to make a module available?**

Node.js modules are a type of package that can be published to npm. To create a new module, start by creating a package.json file. Use npm init to create package.json. It will prompt you for values for fields.
