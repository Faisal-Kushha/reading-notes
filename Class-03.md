### HTML
#### In HTML there are three main types of lists: 

1. `Ordered lists` (`ol`) which are used to listing items by numbers.

| Html Tag| Result       |
| -------------- |
| `<ol>` | |
| `<li>Coffee</li>`| `1.Coffee`  |
| `<li>Tea</li>` | `2.Tea` |
| `<li>Milk</1i>`|`3.Milk`|
| `</ol>`  |    |

2.  `Unordered lists` (`ul`) which are used to listing items by bullets.

| Html Tag| Result       |
| -------------- |
| `<ul>` | |
| `<li>Coffee</li>`| `.Coffee`  |
| `<li>Tea</li>` | `.Tea` |
| `<li>Milk</1i>`|`.Milk`|
| `</ul>`  |    |



3. `Definition lists` which are used to define terminology.

### Lists can be nested inside each another like below:

### CSS 
In CSS all HTML elements can be considered as boxes in terms of the CSS box model, which is essentially a box that wraps content. As shown below:

CSS provide the ability to control the dimensions of the box. In addition we can control the borders, margin and padding for each box.

### JavaScript
#### Arrays:
In JavaScript arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable that are related to each others. The importance of the arrays is when we are using the loops because it save alot of time and effort.

#### The switch statement:
It is used to perform different actions based on different conditions, so it allow you to compare a value against possible outcomes. In addition it provides a default option if there is no case match.

#### If...else statement:
The if statement allows to execute a particular condition if it is true; If the condition is false, another statement will be executed.

#### Loops:
They are the quickest and easiest way to do something repeatedly, in other words they repeat an action some number of times.
Here are some of JavaScript Loops:

1. `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
2. `do...while` statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
3. `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
