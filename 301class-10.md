### The JavaScript Call Stack

**What is a ‘call’?**

`A call stack` is a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).

**How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?**

The call stack is primarily used for function invocation (call). Since the call stack is single, function(s) execution, is done, one at a time, from top to bottom. It means the call stack is synchronous. And `three calls` can happen at once.

**What does LIFO mean?**

`Last In, First Out` it means that the last function that gets pushed into the stack is the first to be pop out, when the function returns.

**Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack.**

`function firstFunction(){`

` throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');`

`}`

`function secondFunction(){`

` firstFunction();`

`}`

`function thirdFunction(){`

` secondFunction();`

`}`

`thirdFunction();`

**What causes a Stack Overflow?**

A stack overflow occurs when there is a recursive function (a function that calls itself) without an exit point. The browser (hosting environment) has a maximum stack call that it can accomodate before throwing a stack error.

### JavaScript error messages & debugging

**What is a ‘refrence error’?**

This happened when you try to use a variable that is not yet declared you get this type os errors.

**What is a ‘syntax error’?**

This occurs when you have something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax, like when you try to parse an invalid object using JSON.parse.

**What is a ‘range error’?**

This occurs when you manipulate with the length of an object and give it an invalid length.

**What is a ‘type error’?**

This types of errors show up when the types (number, string and so on) are used or accessed are incompatible, like accessing a property in an undefined type of variable.

**What is a breakpoint?**

A breakpoint is an intentional stopping or pausing place in a program, put in place for debugging purposes. It is also sometimes simply referred to as a pause. More generally, a breakpoint is a means of acquiring knowledge about a program during its execution.

**What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?**

The debugger keyword stops the execution of JavaScript, and calls (if available) the debugging function. This has the same function as setting a breakpoint in the debugger. If no debugging is available, the debugger statement has no effect. With the debugger turned on, this code will stop executing before it executes the third line.
