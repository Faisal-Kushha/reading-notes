## React and Forms

#### Forms

A Controlled Component is a way that takes its current value through props and notifies changes through callbacks like onChange. A parent component "controls" it by handling the callback and managing its own state and passing the new values as props to the controlled component.

It can sometimes be hard to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and transfer all of the input state through a React component.

The [`<FormControl>`](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/components/forms/) component renders a form control with Bootstrap styling. The `<FormGroup>` component wraps a form control with proper spacing, along with support for a label, help text, and validation state.

#### Ternary Operator

We use a ternary operator to write the conditional statement in a shorter way.

For example:

---

**The traditional way with `if statement`**

`if(x===y){`

`console.log(true);`

`} else {`

`console.log(false);}`

---

**The new way with `Ternary Operator`**

`x===y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);`

#### Conditional Rendering in ReactJS is to create multiple components and render them based on some conditions.
