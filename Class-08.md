## CSS 
CSS allow to control the position of an HTML elements by defining each element as if it has its own box. The box would be either: 


### Box

1. `Block-level box` it create a "block" or "box", browsers typically display the block-level
element with a new line. It may contain inline elements and other block-level elements. It also create "larger"
structure than inline elements. The best practice of it in: `<h1>` `<p>` `<ul>` `<li>`.

2. `Inline box` it flow in between surrounding text. The best practice of it in:`<img>` `<b>` `<i>`.

### Containing Elements: 

It is a block-level element that locate inside other 
block-level element such as the navigation bar and the header in is case the header is `Containing Elements`.


### Controlling the Position of Elements:

CSS allow you to control the elements position of the layout in a webpage in three ways:

1. `Normal flow`

2. `Relative Positioning`

3. `Absolute positioning`

`Box offset` properties help to control where a box should be positioned by telling the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed.

### Screen Sizes

You should think of the different visitors that enter to your website and they may have different screens size, so the website design should be able to work on a different sized screens. In addition to the screen resolution which refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch.
