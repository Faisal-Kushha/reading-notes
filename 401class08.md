## List Comprehensions in Python

List comprehension offers a shorter syntax when you want to create a new list based on the values of an existing list.

## Syntax

```
my_new_list = [ expression for item in list ]
```

1. First is the expression we’d like to carry out. expression inside the square brackets.
2. Second is the object that the expression will work on. item inside the square brackets.
3. Finally, we need an iterable list of objects to build our new list from. list inside the square brackets.

**_Notes about Lists Comprehensions_**

1. List comprehension methods are an elegant way to create and manage lists.
2. In Python, list comprehensions are a more compact way of creating lists.
3. More flexible than for loops, list comprehension is usually faster than other methods.

### Create a simple list

Let’s start easy by creating a simple list.

```
x = [i for i in range(10)]
print x

# This will give the output:
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

That’s how you can create a simple list.

### Create a list using loops and list comprehension

For the next example, assume we want to create a list of squares. Start with an empty list.

```
# You can either use loops:
squares = []

for x in range(10):
    squares.append(x**2)

print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]

# Or you can use list comprehensions to get the same result:
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

print squares
[0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81]
```

Just remember the syntax: [ expression for item in list if conditional ]

### Multiplying parts of a list

Multiply every part of a list by three and assign it to a new list.

```
list1 = [3,4,5]

multiplied = [item*3 for item in list1]

print multiplied
[9,12,15]
```

Note how the item\*3 multiplies each piece by 3.

### Show the first letter of each word

We will take the first letter of each word and make a list out of it.

```
listOfWords = ["this","is","a","list","of","words"]

items = [ word[0] for word in listOfWords ]

print items
```

The output should be: [‘t’, ‘i’, ‘a’, ‘l’, ‘o’, ‘w’]

```
>>> [x.lower() for x in ["A","B","C"]]
['a', 'b', 'c']

>>> [x.upper() for x in ["a","b","c"]]
['A', 'B', 'C']
```

### Print numbers only from a given string

This example show how to extract all the numbers from a string.

```
string = "Hello 12345 World"
numbers = [x for x in string if x.isdigit()]
print numbers

>> ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']
```

Change x.isdigit() to x.isalpha() if you don’t want any numbers.

### Parsing a file using list comprehension

In this example, we can see how to get specific lines out from a text file.

Create a text file and put in some text in it.

this is line1
this is line2
this is line3
this is line4
this is line5

Save the file as test.txt

```
# Then create the filter by using list comprehension:

fh = open("test.txt", "r")

result = [i for i in fh if "line3" in i]

print result
```

Output: [‘this is line3‘]

### Using list comprehension in functions

Now, let’s see how we can use list comprehension in functions.

```
# Create a function and name it double:
def double(x):
  return x*2

# If you now just print that function with a value in it, it should look like this:
>>> print double(10)
20
```

We can easily use list comprehension on that function.

```
>>> [double(x) for x in range(10)]

print double
[0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18]

# You can put in conditions:

>>> [double(x) for x in range(10) if x%2==0]
[0, 4, 8, 12, 16]

# You can add more arguments:

>>> [x+y for x in [10,30,50] for y in [20,40,60]]
[30, 50, 70, 50, 70, 90, 70, 90, 110]
```

See how you can put in conditions and add more arguments.
