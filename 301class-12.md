# CRUD

**In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:**

`100’s` These are informational status codes; they usually tell the client that the header part of the request has been received and the server will try to comply with a transmission demand of the client. Like using a different protocol or telling the client that its request will fail before they start sending the body.

`200’s` These are the success codes. They tell the client that its request was accepted. In case of asynchronous processing of a request (202), this doesn’t mean the request was successfully processed only that it met all validation requirements at the time of sending.

`300’s` These are redirection codes. They tell the client that the resource they are requesting isn’t available at the expected location anymore. This can have multiple reasons, be temporary or permanent, but the client has to issue a request to the new location.

`400’s` These are the client error codes. They are all about invalid requests a client sent to a server. There are several causes to this, timeouts, wrong URI, missing authentication, etc. A client is sending incorrect input and should confirm the input parameters are correct before retrying the request.

`500’s` These are the server error codes. Often they indicate problems with overwhelmed servers or unreachable servers behind proxies, but sometimes they can be directly related to client requests that trigger error exceptions on the server. These errors can be temporary or permanent. Usually it’s best for the client to retry the same request.

**What is a status code 202?**

Accepted - Often used for asynchronous processing. This code tells the client that the request was valid, but its processing will finish sometime in the future. The response body should include an URL to the finished resource with some information about when it will be available, or an URL to some monitoring endpoint that tells the client when the resource is available.

**What is a status code 308?**

Permanent Redirect - This tells the client to use another URL to access the resource and not use the current URL anymore. It’s helpful when we have multiple endpoints for one resource, but don’t want to implement reading from all of them.

**What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?**

406 Not Acceptable - The URL exists, but the backend can’t send a representation the client will accept. So for that specific client, the URL behaves like a 404, but they now know that they need to update the client.

**What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?**

404 Not Found - If 401 or 403 is the case, but the backend doesn’t want to tell the client that the resource exists for security reasons.

**What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?**

403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

**Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?**

Because we want to use something that is not our localhost.

**What is middleware?**

It is those methods/functions/operations that are called BETWEEN processing the Request and sending the Response in your application method.

**What does app.use(express.json()) do?**

`express.json()` is a method inbuilt in express to recognize the incoming Request Object as a JSON Object. This method is called as a middleware in your application using the code: `app.use(express.json())`.

**What does the /:id mean in a route?**

The `id` is the normal id for anything but using it in this way it means that it's a parameter and we can access it by request.

**What is the difference beween PUT and PATCH?**

`PUT` requires the client to send an entire representation of a resource to update it.

`PATCH` requires the client only send parts of the representation of the resource to update it.

**How do you make a default value in a schema?**

Defaults can be either functions which return the value to use as the default or the literal value itself. Either way, the value will be cast based on its schema type before being set during document creation.

**What does a 500 error status code mean?**

`500` means Internal Server Error, which can be anything from a missing header field the backend accessed without checking its existence to an unreachable third party service the backend wanted to call.

**What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?**

`200` OK - It’s the basic status code to tell the client everything went good. Since we don’t create endpoint accessible resource when creating an access token, we can use 200 as a status for that action.

`201` Created - The most fitting for Create operations. This code should signal backend-side resource creation and come along with a Location header that defines the most specific URL for that newly created resource. It’s also a good idea to include appropriate representation of the resource or at least one or more URLs to that resource in the response body.
