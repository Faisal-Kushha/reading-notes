## Passing Functions as Props

`.map()` return returns a map object (which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item alsoif you want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX you have to use map. Each list item needs a unique `string` to pick a key. The purpose of a `key` it is useful when working with dynamically created components or when your lists are altered by the users.

The [Spread operator](https://medium.com/coding-at-dawn/how-to-use-the-spread-operator-in-javascript-b9e4a8b06fab) refers to the use of an ellipsis of three dots (…) to expand an iterable object into the list of arguments.

`Spread operator` is a useful and quick syntax for:

1. **Adding items to arrays**
2. **Combining arrays or objects** 
3. **Spreading an array out into a function’s arguments**
4. **Using Math functions**


This is an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays:

`let arr1 = [0, 1, 2];`

`let arr2 = [3, 5, 7];`

`let primes = arr1.concat(arr2);`

`// > [0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7]`

This is an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array:

`const number = [4, 5, 6]`

`const number2 = [1, 2, 3, ...number]`

`console.log(number2)`

` The result => [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6  ]`

### Lifting State Up
It is an important pattern because sometimes we have state that’s located within a particular component that also needs to be shared with sibling components.
