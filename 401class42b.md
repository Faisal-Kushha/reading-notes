**The ethical dilemmas of self-driving cars**

Self-driving cars can do reduce the percentage of car accident. However, it might cause an accident because it lack for the right sense in some situation, such as if a child suddenly jump over the road how should it deal with such a situation or if the road was slippery and the accident was inevitablehow should it behave ? So I do agree there should be some restrictions on self-driving cars.

**The code I’m still ashamed of**

First of all I do agree with this article. Some of the softwares nowadays have a bad side effects on some of the users and even it might harm them so as a results each developer should know enough information about the code he/she write and think twice about the effects of their code before I write it.
