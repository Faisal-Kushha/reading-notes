# Wireframe & HTML

#### Wireframes is a two dimentional skeletal outline of a webpage or app. It helps the designer to imagine how their design will looks like on screen.

#### Wireframes types: 
1. Pysical hand drawn sketch using paper, pencils and marker. 
2. Digital wireframe using software like `Invision` or `Balsamiq`.

#### There are Six steps to make a wireframe: 
1. Do the reasearch.
2. Prepare the research for quick reference.
3. Make sure to have the user flow mapped out.
4. Draft, don’t draw. Sketch, don’t illustrate.
5. Add some detail and get testing.
6. Start turning the wireframes into prototypes.

#### Also here are three Key Principles to make Wireframe looks Good:
1. Clarity
2. Confidence
3. Simplicity

#### HTML stand for (HyperText Markup Language) and it is the standard markup language for Web pages structure. Along side HTML there are other languages used to launch a completed web page's like
* `CSS` for appearance/presentation 
* `JavaScript` for functionality/behavior.

#### "Hypertext" refers to links that connect web pages to one another, either within a single website or between websites. HTML depends on a series of elements that is used to make the content appear or act in a certain way.

#### HTML element contains number of parts that make it meaningful and functional as illustrated below:

![HTML ELEMENTS](https://cdo-curriculum.s3.amazonaws.com/media/uploads/html_element.png)

1. **The opening tag**: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect — in this case where the paragraph begins.
2. **The closing tag**: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. This states where the element ends — in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
3. **The content**: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
4. **The element**: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.

#### HTML elements can have attributes, the attributes provide additional information about elements and they are always specified in the start tag, In addition they are usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"

#### An attribute should always have the following:

1. A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).
2. The attribute name followed by an equal sign.
3. The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.

#### Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code. Here is a list of [HTML Semantic elements](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

#### The benefits from writing semantic markup are as follows:

1. Search engines will consider its contents as important keywords to influence the page's search rankings.
2. Screen readers can use it as a signpost to help visually impaired users navigate a page.
3. Finding blocks of meaningful code is significantly easier.
4. Suggests to the developer the type of data that will be populated.
5. Semantic naming mirrors proper custom element/component naming.
