# Django Models

Django web applications access and manage data through Python objects referred to as models. Models define the structure of stored data, including the field types and possibly also their maximum size, default values, selection list options, help text for documentation, label text for forms, etc.

**Model definition**

Models are usually defined in an application's models.py file. They are implemented as subclasses of django.db.models.Model, and can include fields, methods and metadata.

**Fields**

A model can have an arbitrary number of fields, of any type — each one represents a column of data that we want to store in one of our database tables. Each database record (row) will consist of one of each field value.

**Metadata**

You can declare model-level metadata for your Model by declaring class Meta

**Methods**

A model can also have methods. Minimally, in every model you should define the standard Python class method `__str__()` to return a human-readable string for each object. This string is used to represent individual records in the administration site (and anywhere else you need to refer to a model instance). Often this will return a title or name field from the model.

Another common method to include in Django models is `get_absolute_url()`, which returns a URL for displaying individual model records on the website (if you define this method then Django will automatically add a "View on Site" button to the model's record editing screens in the Admin site).

## Defining the LocalLibrary Models

**Genre model**

Copy the Genre model code shown below and paste it into the bottom of your models.py file. This model is used to store information about the book category — for example whether it is fiction or non-fiction, romance or military history, etc.

**Book model**

Copy the Book model below and again paste it into the bottom of your file. The Book model represents all information about an available book in a general sense, but not a particular physical "instance" or "copy" available for loan. The model uses a CharField to represent the book's title and isbn .

## Django admin site

The Django admin application can use your models to automatically build a site area that you can use to create, view, update, and delete records. This can save you a lot of time during development, making it very easy to test your models and get a feel for whether you have the right data. The admin application can also be useful for managing data in production, depending on the type of website. The Django project recommends it only for internal data management (i.e. just for use by admins, or people internal to your organization), as the model-centric approach is not necessarily the best possible interface for all users, and exposes a lot of unnecessary detail about the models.

**Creating a superuser**

In order to log into the admin site, we need a user account with Staff status enabled. In order to view and create records we also need this user to have permissions to manage all our objects. You can create a "superuser" account that has full access to the site and all needed permissions using manage.py.

Call the following command, in the same directory as manage.py, to create the superuser. You will be prompted to enter a username, email address, and strong password.

`python3 manage.py createsuperuser`

Once this command completes a new superuser will have been added to the database. Now restart the development server so we can test the login:

`python3 manage.py runserver`

**Logging in and using the site**

To login to the site, open the /admin URL `http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin` and enter your new superuser userid and password credentials (you'll be redirected to the login page, and then back to the /admin URL after you've entered your details).

This part of the site displays all our models, grouped by installed application. You can click on a model name to go to a screen that lists all its associated records, and you can further click on those records to edit them. You can also directly click the Add link next to each model to start creating a record of that type.
