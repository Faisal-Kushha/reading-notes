# Trees

We will be covering Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees, and K-ary Trees. We will review some common terminology that is shared amongst all of the trees and then dive into specifics of the different types.

## Traversals

An important aspect of trees is how to traverse them. Traversing a tree allows us to search for a node, print out the contents of a tree, and much more! There are two categories of traversals when it comes to trees:

- Depth First
- Breadth First

## Depth First

Depth first traversal is where we prioritize going through the depth (height) of the tree first. There are multiple ways to carry out depth first traversal, and each method changes the order in which we search/print the root. Here are three methods for depth first traversal:

- Pre-order: root >> left >> right
- In-order: left >> root >> right
- Post-order: left >> right >> root

- Pre-order: A, B, D, E, C, F
- In-order: D, B, E, A, F, C
- Post-order: D, E, B, F, C, A

The most common way to traverse through a tree is to use recursion. With these traversals, we rely on the call stack to navigate back up the tree when we have reached the end of a sub-path.

## Pre-order

Pre-order means that the root has to be looked at first. In our case, looking at the root just means that we output its value. When we call preOrder for the first time, the root will be added to the call stack.

This means that we will output the root.value out to the console. Then, our next block of code instructs us to check if our root has a left node set. If the root does, we will then send the left node to our preOrder method recursively. This means that we make another function call.

## Breadth First

Breadth first traversal iterates through the tree by going through each level of the tree node-by-node.

Traditionally, breadth first traversal uses a queue (instead of the call stack via recursion) to traverse the width/breadth of the tree.

## Binary Tree Vs K-ary Trees

Binary Trees restrict the number of children to two (hence our left and right children). There is no specific sorting order for a binary tree. Nodes can be added into a binary tree wherever space allows.

### K-ary Trees

If Nodes are able have more than 2 child nodes, we call the tree that contains them a K-ary Tree. In this type of tree we use K to refer to the maximum number of children that each Node is able to have.

### Breadth First Traversal

Traversing a K-ary tree requires a similar approach to the breadth first traversal. We are still pushing nodes into a queue, but we are now moving down a list of children of length k, instead of checking for the presence of a left and a right child.

### Adding a node

Because there are no structural rules for where nodes are “supposed to go” in a binary tree, it really doesn’t matter where a new node gets placed.

One strategy for adding a new node to a binary tree is to fill all “child” spots from the top down. To do so, we would leverage the use of breadth first traversal. During the traversal, we find the first node that does not have all it’s children filled, and insert the new node as a child. We fill the child slots from left to right.

In the event you would like to have a node placed in a specific location, you need to reference both the new node to create, and the parent node upon which the child is attached to.

### Big O

The Big O time complexity for inserting a new node is O(n). Searching for a specific node will also be O(n). Because of the lack of organizational structure in a Binary Tree, the worst case for most operations will involve traversing the entire tree. If we assume that a tree has n nodes, then in the worst case we will have to look at n items, hence the O(n) complexity.

The Big O space complexity for a node insertion using breadth first insertion will be O(w), where w is the largest width of the tree. For example, in the above tree, w is 4.

A “perfect” binary tree is one where every non-leaf node has exactly two children. The maximum width for a perfect binary tree, is 2^(h-1), where h is the height of the tree. Height can be calculated as log n, where n is the number of nodes.

## Binary Search Trees

A Binary Search Tree (BST) is a type of tree that does have some structure attached to it. In a BST, nodes are organized in a manner where all values that are smaller than the root are placed to the left, and all values that are larger than the root are placed to the right.

### Searching a BST

Searching a BST can be done quickly, because all you do is compare the node you are searching for against the root of the tree or sub-tree. If the value is smaller, you only traverse the left side. If the value is larger, you only traverse the right side.

Let’s say we are searching 15. We start by comparing the value 15 to the value of the root, 23.

15 < 23, so we traverse the left side of the tree. We then treat 8 as our new “root” to compare against.

15 > 8, so we traverse the right side. 16 is our new root.

15 < 16, so we traverse the left side. And aha! 15 is our new root and also a match with what we were searching for.
