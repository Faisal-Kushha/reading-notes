# Programming with JavaScript
#### In order to know how to code with JavaScript we have to define the most important aspect in this language which is the funcitons.
#### JavaScript functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task, taking some form of input and returning an output. 
#### To define a [function](https://www.javascript.com/learn/functions), we must use the function keyword, followed by a name, followed by parentheses `( )`. Then we have to write the function logic between curly brackets `{ }`.
For example :

![JS function](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*X0RHMCrDLuvoaiB1f0pRFg.png)

## Function expressions:
#### Functions can also be created by a function expression. Such a function can be anonymous; it does not have to have a name. For example, the function square could have been defined as:

![expression](https://s3.amazonaws.com/dashingd3js/d3-lesson-images/lesson-84/javascript-function-operator-call-versus-javascript-function-expression-call_720x355.png)

## Calling functions:
#### Calling the function is the last step to execute the function and it actually performs the specified actions with the indicated parameters `( )`.

#### [Functions](https://www.javascript.com/learn/functions) are great for efficiency - you can define it one time and then use it multiple times, as needed. You don't have to rewrite the same or similar code over and over again. JavaScript functions also allow you to plug in different inputs, or arguments, to get different results, based on the information you are working with. Using JavaScript functions saves a lot of time and makes your code less cumbersome.
