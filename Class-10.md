### Error Handling & Debugging

JavaScript is a hard programming language to learn,in the learning process it is obviously that you might have a mistakes; However how could you know where are your mistakes or where is the error in your code, as a results there are some method that manage you to track your mistakes and find the exact location of them.

In JavaScript your code is running one by one, so if you have a statement that call another function this function will take the priority, once it finish the work that it sapouse to do it goes back to its original order.

In order to find the error in your code, you to understand the execution contexts which have two 
steps:

1. `Prepare`

* The new scope is created. 
* Variables, functions, and arguments are created. 
* The value of the this keyword is determined. 


2. `Execute`
* Now it can assign values to variables. 
* Reference functions and run their code. 
* Execute statements.

Debugging is the process of detecting and removing of existing and potential errors in a software code that can cause it to behave unexpectedly or crash.

Practical tips when debugging a scripts:

1. Try another Browser

2. Add numbers

3. Strip it back

4. Explaining the code

5. Search

6. Code playground
