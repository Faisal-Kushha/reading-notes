The article was talking about finding the best combination to create a successful group or team, along the article there were a lot of experiments in order to get the same result which is the perfect team.

the first experiment held at Yale University, it was by finding a team from the same background and study field but it failed because every team member was almost selfish and trying to prove that he/she is the leader, the other one was by creating a group of people from different background and study field and it was more successful than the first one.

At google they start a project called  `Aristotle` which was studying the psychological and sociological behavior of google employee in order to find the perfect team and they divided the employee in two groups:

1. Group A the team members came from the same background and they act serious and strict to the their appointment.
2. Group B the team members came from different background and they are more flexible and they are  friends even outside the work environment.

Additionally they could not reach to any results. However after a years of studying and observing the employee; they reach to a conclusion by coincidence that the norm that affect on the team performance is the `social sensitivity` by encouraging the employees to be supportive and compassionate, `psychological safety` by encouraging the employees not to be sarcastic or negative criticizer, in other words when the a team member feel safe on the  psychological side and have the ability to share his/her feelings and ideas no matter how he/she is in comparison to other members. This norm was the clue to create the best team or group.
