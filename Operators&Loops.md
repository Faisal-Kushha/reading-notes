# JavaScript Operators and Loops

### Expressions and operators:

#### As we mentioned before JavaScript Operators are symbols that are used to perform operations, JavaScript has both binary and unary operators, and one special ternary operator, the conditional operator. 

##### A binary operator requires two operands, one before the operator and one after the operator:
For example: `23-11` or `x/y`

##### A unary operator requires a single operand, either before or after the operator:
For example: `y++` or `++y`

### Types of Operators:
1. Assignment operators: It assigns a value to its left operand based on the value of its right operand. The simple assignment operator is equal `=`, which assigns the value of its right operand to its left operand. That is, `x = y` assigns the value of `y` to `x`. 
You could check [Assignment Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) to have an overview.
2. Comparison operators: It compares its operands and returns a logical value based on whether the comparison is true. The operands can be numerical, string, logical, or object values fro example: `x == y`or `x !== y`. You could check [Comparison Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) to have an overview.
3. Arithmetic operators: It takes numerical values (either literals or variables) as their operands and returns a single numerical value for example: `x + y`. You could check [Arithmetic Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) to have an overview.
4. Bitwise operators: It treats their operands as a set of 32 bits (zeros and ones), rather than as decimal, hexadecimal, or octal numbers. For example`x >> y`. You could check [Bitwise Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) to have an overview.
5. Logical operators: They are typically used with Boolean values; when they are true, they return a Boolean value fro example: `x || y` or `x && y`. You could check [Logical Operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators) to have an overview.

#### There are some operators that can be used with another operators like: `String operators` and `Comma operator`. In addition there is an operators that work only with one operand like `Unary operators`.

### Expressions: is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value. JavaScript has the following expression categories:

| Expressions       |
| -------------- |
| Arithmetic: evaluates to a number. | 
| String: evaluates to a character string.   |
| Logical: evaluates to true or false.   |
| Primary expressions: Basic keywords and general expressions in JavaScript.|
| Left-hand-side expressions: Left values are the destination of an assignment.      |


## Loops:
##### They are the quickest and easiest way to do something repeatedly, in other words they repeat an action some number of times.
Here are some of JavaScript Loops:

1. `for` loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
2. `do...while` statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.
3. `while` statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.
