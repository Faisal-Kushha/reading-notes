# Linked Lists

## What is a Linked List

A Linked List is a sequence of Nodes that are connected/linked to each other. The most defining feature of a Linked List is that each Node references the next Node in the link.

There are two types of Linked List - Singly and Doubly. We will be implementing a Singly Linked List in this implementation.

## Terminology:

1. Linked List - A data structure that contains nodes that links/points to the next node in the list.
2. Singly - Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
3. Doubly - Doubly refers to there being two (double) references within the node. A Doubly linked list means that there is a reference to both the Next and Previous node.
4. Node - Nodes are the individual items/links that live in a linked list. Each node contains the data for each link.
5. Next - Each node contains a property called Next. This property contains the reference to the next node.
6. Head - The Head is a reference of type Node to the first node in a linked list.
7. Current - The Current is a reference of type Node to the node that is currently being looked at. When traversing, you create a new Current variable at the Head to guarantee you are starting from the beginning of the linked list.

## Traversal

When traversing a linked list, you are not able to use a foreach or for loop. We depend on the Next value in each node to guide us where the next reference is pointing. The Next property is exceptionally important because it will lead us where the next node is and allow us to extract the data appropriately

The best way to approach a traversal is through the use of a while() loop. This allows us to continually check that the Next node in the list is not null. If we accidentally end up trying to traverse on a node that is null, a NullReferenceException gets thrown and our program will crash/end.

When traversing through a linked list, the Current variable will tell us where exactly in the linked list we are and will allow us to move/traverse forward until we hit the end

What exactly is happening:

1. We are first creating Current at the Head to guarantee we are starting from the beginning. (Remember that Head is always the first node in a Linked List)

2. We create a while loop. This loop will only run if the node that Current is pointing to is not null. This also means we can guarantee that we are still looking at a Node while the loop is running.

3. Once we are in the while loop, we are checking if the value of the current node is equal to the value we are looking for. Given the logic, if that condition is true, then we have found the value we were looking for, so we return true.

4. If the Current node does not contain the value we are looking for, we then must move Current to the next node that is being referenced. Again, because the condition of this while loop is to only run if we are still at a node, we can safely traverse to the next node without fear of getting a NullReferenceException.

5. At this point, the while loop is re-evaluated. Step 3 & 4 will continue until Current reaches the end of the LinkedList. We will know we are at the last node in the linked list because the current node will be null. Once this condition becomes true, the while loop breaks, and we now know that we are at the end.

6. Once we hit the end, we know that we did not find the value and return true at any point, so the value is not in the LinkedList. We return false.

## Traversal Big O

The Big O of time for Includes would be O(n). This is because, at its worse case, the node we are looking for will be the very last node in the linked list. n represents the number of nodes in the linked list.

The Big O of space for Includes would be O(1). This is because there is no additional space being used than what is already given to us with the linked list input.

## Adding a Node

Order of operations is extremely important when it comes to working with a Linked List. What I mean by this is you must be careful that all references to each link/node is properly assigned.

An example can be with adding a node to a linked list. If we want to add a node with an O(1) efficiency, we have to replace the current Head of the linked list with the new node, without losing the reference to the next node in the list.

Here are the required steps to add a new node with an O(1) efficiency.

1. We can then instantiate the new node that we are adding. The values passed in as arguments into the Add() method will define what the value of the Node will be.

2. newNode.Next by default is set to null. We want to set newNode.Next property to the same location that the Head node is pointing towards. Because Head is just a reference type, we will be assigning it to the same allocation in memory as the node it is pointing too. In this case, it’s Node1

3. At this point in the program we now “technically” have newNode at the beginning of the linked list, but we are not done yet. We now have to re-assign where Head is pointing too. Since Node1 is no longer the first node in the list, we want to re-assign Head to point at newNode.

Regardless of the number of Nodes that this linked list has, it will always be a O(1) time and space because it takes the same amount of time to add a new node to the beginning of the list, and no additional resources are being used

## Adding a Node O(n)

Adding a node to the middle of a linked list is a bit different than adding to the beginning. This is because we are working with more nodes and must re-allocate to make room for the new node.

1. Let’s start out with a basic Singly Linked List:

2. Now let’s create a new node (node6). We will set the value of node6 to be 16. The Next will be null because we haven’t yet attached it into the linked list.

3. Now let’s start the adding. We can do an AddBefore method or an AddAfter. For this documentation, we will do an AddBefore. The AddAfter is extremely similar…see if you can figure it out on your own!

Our AddBefore method that we will demonstrate will insert node6 before node4.

## Print Out Nodes

Printing out all of the nodes in a Linked List is very similar to what we did in the Includes() method. This is because we are leveraging our Current node and a while loop to traverse through the existing linked list.

Much like in Includes, we are creating a while loop to check and make sure we are not at the end of a linked list. Right before the while loop restarts, we move Current to equal the next node in the list.

Once we hit the end, we write out the null pointed to by the last node (or Head, if it’s empty).

# Linear data structures

If we really want to understand the basics of linked lists, it’s important that we talk about what type of data structure they are.
One characteristic of linked lists is that they are linear data structures, which means that there is a sequence and an order to how they are constructed and traversed. We can think of a linear data structure like a game of hopscotch: in order to get to the end of the list, we have to go through all of the items in the list in order, or sequentially. Linear structures, however, are the opposite of non-linear structures. In non-linear data structures, items don’t have to be arranged in order, which means that we could traverse the data structure non-sequentially.

## Memory management

The biggest differentiator between arrays and linked lists is the way that they use memory in our machines. Those of us who work with dynamically typed languages like Ruby, JavaScript, or Python don’t have to think about how much memory an array uses when we write our code on a day to day basis because there are several layers of abstraction that end up with us not having to worry about memory allocation at all.

When an array is created, it needs a certain amount of memory. If we had 7 letters that we needed to store in an array, we would need 7 bytes of memory to represent that array. But, we’d need all of that memory in one contiguous block. That is to say, our computer would need to locate 7 bytes of memory that was free, one byte next to the another, all together, in one place.

On the other hand, when a linked list is born, it doesn’t need 7 bytes of memory all in one place. One byte could live somewhere, while the next byte could be stored in another place in memory altogether! Linked lists don’t need to take up a single block of memory; instead, the memory that they use can be scattered throughout.

The fundamental difference between arrays and linked lists is that arrays are static data structures, while linked lists are dynamic data structures. A static data structure needs all of its resources to be allocated when the structure is created; this means that even if the structure was to grow or shrink in size and elements were to be added or removed, it still always needs a given size and amount of memory. If more elements needed to be added to a static data structure and it didn’t have enough memory, you’d need to copy the data of that array, for example, and recreate it with more memory, so that you could add elements to it.

## Parts of a linked list

A linked list can be small or huge, but no matter the size, the parts that make it up are actually fairly simple. A linked list is made up of a series of nodes, which are the elements of the list.

The starting point of the list is a reference to the first node, which is referred to as the head. Nearly all linked lists must have a head, because this is effectively the only entry point to the list and all of its elements, and without it, you wouldn’t know where to start! The end of the list isn’t a node, but rather a node that points to null, or an empty value.

A single node is also pretty simple. It has just two parts: data, or the information that the node contains, and a reference to the next node.

## What is Big O?

The same goes for Big O Notation, but on a much lower level. Big O Notation is a way of evaluating the performance of an algorithm.

One way to think about Big O notation is a way to express the amount of time that a function, action, or algorithm takes to run based on how many elements we pass to that function.

As far as linked lists go, however, the two types of Big O equations to remember are O(1) and O(n).

An O(1) function takes constant time, which is to say that it doesn’t matter how many elements we have, or how huge our input is: it’ll always take the same amount of time and memory to run our algorithm. An O(n) function is linear, which means that as our input grows (from ten numbers, to ten thousand, to ten million), the space and time that we need to run that algorithm grows linearly.

For a little contrast, we can also compare these two functions to something starkly different: an O(n²) function, which clearly takes exponentially more time and memory the more elements that you have. It’s pretty safe to say that we want to avoid O(n²) algorithms, just from looking at that crazy red line!

## To list or not to list?

If you ever find yourself having to do something that requires a lot of traversal, iteration, or quick index-level access, a linked list could be your worst enemy. In those situations, an array might be a better solution, since you can find things quickly (a single chunk of allocated memory), and you can use an index to quickly retrieve a random element in the middle or end of the list without having to take the time to traverse through the whole entire thing.
