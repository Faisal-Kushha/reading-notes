# REST

**What does REST stand for?**

Representational State Transfer

**REST APIs are designed around resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client.**

**A resource has an identifier, which is a URI that uniquely identifies that resource. For example, the URI for a particular customer order might be:**

`https://adventure-works.com/orders/1`

**What are the most common HTTP verbs?**

The HTTP protocol defines a number of methods that assign semantic meaning to a request. The common HTTP methods used by most RESTful web APIs are:

1. GET retrieves a representation of the resource at the specified URI. The body of the response message contains the details of the requested resource.

2. POST creates a new resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message provides the details of the new resource.

3. PUT either creates or replaces the resource at the specified URI. The body of the request message specifies the resource to be created or updated.

4. PATCH performs a partial update of a resource. The request body specifies the set of changes to apply to the resource.

5. DELETE removes the resource at the specified URI.

**What should the URIs be based on?**

URIs should be based on nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource).

**Give an example of a good URI.**

For example, /customers is the path to the customers collection, and /customers/5 is the path to the customer with ID equal to 5.

**What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?**

Another factor is that all web requests impose a load on the web server. The more requests, the bigger the load. Therefore, try to avoid "chatty" web APIs that expose a large number of small resources.

**What status code does a successful GET request return?**

A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).

**What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?**

Unsuccessful GET method return 404 (Not Found).

**What status code does a successful POST request return?**

It returns HTTP status code 201 (Created).

**What status code does a successful DELETE request return?**

If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content).
