## CSS 
CSS3 offer a new ways to position the elements. The old and tradional techniques can be replaced with alternative ways to size, position, and change elements. All of these new techniques are applied by using the `transform` property.

### Transform property
The transform property have two different settings and each one of them come with their own individual properties and values:

1. `Two-dimensional` 

2. `Three-dimensional`


### Transitions property
Transition is having the ability to replace the appearance and behavior of an element when a state change occurs, such as when it is hovered over, focused on, active, or targeted.

There are four transition related properties in total, including:

1. `transition-property`

2. `transition-duration`

3. `transition-timing-function`

4. `transition-delay` 

Below there are eight simple effects of transitions property:

1. Fade in

2. Change color

3. Grow and Shrink

4. Rotate elements

5. Square to circle

6. 3D shadow

7. Swing

8. Inset border

### Animations

Using the animations will allow you to change and replace the appearance and behavior of an element in multiple keyframes. Transitions provide a change from one state to another, while animations can set multiple points of transition upon different keyframes by using `@keyframes` rule.
