# Django REST Framework & Docker

Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. Because all of the containers share the services of a single operating system kernel, they use fewer resources than virtual machines.

**Linux Containers**

Docker is really just Linux containers which are a type of virtualization. And it has its roots at the beginning of computer science when large, expensive mainframe computers were the norm. How could multiple programmers use the same single machine? The answer was virtualization and specifically virtual machines which are complete copies of a computer system from the operating system on up.

**Install Docker**

After installing `Docker` you can check its version by entering this command in your terminal:

```
$ docker --version
Docker version 19.03.5, build 633a0ea

```

Docker Compose is an additional tool that is automatically included with Mac and Windows downloads of Docker. However if you are on Linux, you will need to add it manually. You can do this by running the command `sudo pip install docker-compose` after your Docker installation is complete.

To confirm Docker installed correctly we can run our first command `docker run hello-world`. This will download an official image and then run the container.

**Images and Containers**

Images and containers are the two fundamental concepts to grasp when you start with Docker. An image is a snapshot in time of what a project contains. A container is a running instance of the image.

**Library Website and API**

Django REST Framework works alongside the Django web framework to create web APIs. We cannot build a web API with only Django Rest Framework; it always must be added to a project after Django itself has been installed and configured.
