# Google Experience

The article was talking about finding the best combination to create a successful group or team, along the article there were a lot of experiments in order to get the same result which is the perfect team.

the first experiment held at Yale University, it was by finding a team from the same background and study field but it failed because every team member was almost selfish and trying to prove that he/she is the leader, the other one was by creating a group of people from different background and study field and it was more successful than the first one.

At google they start a project called `Aristotle` which was studying the psychological and sociological behavior of google employee in order to find the perfect team and they divided the employee in two groups:

1. Group A the team members came from the same background and they act serious and strict to the their appointment.
2. Group B the team members came from different background and they are more flexible and they are friends even outside the work environment.

Additionally they could not reach to any results. However after a years of studying and observing the employee; they reach to a conclusion by coincidence that the norm that affect on the team performance is the `social sensitivity` by encouraging the employees to be supportive and compassionate, `psychological safety` by encouraging the employees not to be sarcastic or negative criticizer, in other words when the a team member feel safe on the psychological side and have the ability to share his/her feelings and ideas no matter how he/she is in comparison to other members. This norm was the clue to create the best team or group.

### Rest

**Who is Roy Fielding?**

Roy Fielding is an American computer scientist, one of the principal authors of the HTTP specification and the originator of the Representational State Transfer architectural style.

**Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?**

Because they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

**What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?**

It is about applying verbs to nouns.

**What does a GET do?**

When you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you typed in and back comes a web page.

**What does a POST do?**

If one system needs to add something to another system, it would use an HTTP verb of POST.

**What does PUT do?**

If a system wants to replace something in another system, it uses an HTTP verb of PUT.

**What does PATCH do?**

It do a partial update.
